# SOC-Fundamentals_practice
This repository contains my hands-on SOC analyst training projects from LetsDefend and TryHackMe, including log analysis, EDR, Threat intelligence feed, SOAR.

 Case 1: Brute Force Detection on VPN
 Platform: LetsDefend
 Scenario: Login failure alert from one source IP with many different accounts.
 Action: Investigated logs, confirmed brute force attempt.
 Learning: Importance of identifying failed login patterns.


 Case 2: RDP Brute Force Detected
 Platform: LetsDefend
 Scenario: Login failure alert from one source IP with many user name accounts.
 Action: Investigated logs, confirmed brute force attempt.
 Learning: Importance of identifying failed login patterns, lerning external threat through log management.

  Case 3: Hacking website in legal  eniroment to depost funds
 Platform: TryHackMe (intro to offensive security)
 Scenario: Brute force attack to find hidden features used for depositing funds.
 Action:  Use Dirb tool to find hidden webpages, testing them one by one until find correct one and depost money.
 Learning:Understood how hidden directories can expose functionality (forms, upload pages) that increase attack surface.
  
 
 Case 4: Simulated SOC investigation using SIEM
 Platform: TryHackMe (intro to defensive security)
 Scenario: Investigation of malicious IP address by scanning tools
 Action:  Detected malicious activity, investigated IP addresses via scanning tools, and escalated to block malicious IPs as part of the incident response workflow.‚Äù 
 Learning: Understand Importance of Detection , investigation and response.



 Cases 5:
This alert was investigated in LetsDefend (training SOC environment). All hostnames/IPs are part of the simulated lab environment no real data exposed. 
 Privilege Escalation, Medium ,severity alert (SOC335) LetsDefend
 Closed as True Positive after finding a suspecious svohost executed via PowerShell.
 Folder documents a case study with screenshots, notes including Investigation, IOC, Timeline and mitigation steps.
